		KXStitch is a program that lets you create cross stitch patterns and
		charts. Patterns can be created from scratch on a user defined size
		of grid, which can be enlarged or reduced in size as your pattern
		progresses. Alternatively you can import images from many graphics
		formats or scan images using any Sane supported scanner. Both of
		these options allow you to restrict the conversion to full stitches
		or optionally use fractional stitches. You may also use an image as
		a background. These imported images can then be modified using the
		supplied tools to produce your final design.
