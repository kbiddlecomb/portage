		Heyu is a console program for remotely controlling lights and appliances.

		Heyu uses the CM11A computer interface to send and receive X10 control
		signals over the AC power lines to modules which can turn On, Off, or Dim
		attached lamps or appliances. It can store a schedule of timed events in
		the CM11A memory for execution when the computer is turned off or
		disconnected.

		Heyu supports an optional W800RF32A, MR26A, or RFXCOM RF receiver connected
		to a second port as an auxiliary input device for X10 RF signals.

		Heyu can also use an optional CM17A interface to transmit X10 RF signals.
