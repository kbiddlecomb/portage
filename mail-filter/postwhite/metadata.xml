		Postwhite is a policy server for Postfix MTA which filters incoming emails
		based on per recipient whitelists managed by an email frontend.
		
		Incoming emails are denied unless the sender address or sender domain is 
		present on the recipient's whitelist. This concept is neither new nor fancy
		in itself, but the way Postwhite lets you manage your whitelist sure is.

		Here is a real life example:

		Arthur's main email address arthur@dent.tld is great for everyday
		use, but he doesn't want to pollute it by using it for mailing lists,
		websites, online shopping and such. Postwhite to the rescue! Arthur creates 
		a virtual email address hitchhike@dent.tld which is delivered to 
		the same mailbox. He adds this address to recipients.yml and then
		restarts Postwhite.

		Initially, all incoming emails will be denied, so when Arthur decides to 
		join the Betelgeuse mailing list, his whitelist has to learn about this. 
		Arthur sends an empty email to hitchhike+learn@dent.tld which
		puts Postwhite into learning mode for a limited period of time. In learning
		mode, Postwhite allows and delivers any incoming mails, yet it
		delivers a followup notification message along with it. When the first 
		email from the Betelgeuse mailing list comes in, Arthur simply replies to 
		the corresponding notification message thus adding Betelgeuse to the 
		whitelist.
