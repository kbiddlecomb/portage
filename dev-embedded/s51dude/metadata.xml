	 s51dude is an In-System programming tool specifically designed to be used
	 with the usbtinyisp board and the Atmel's 8051 family of micrcontrollers.

	 This program is intended to cover the need of the 8051 developer who wants
	 to program the devices with computers without parallel or serial port. The
	 only alternative left is to use the USB port. That is when you will need
	 s51dude.

	 Before being able to use this software, you need to have a working
	 usbtinyisp board. For more information, please read:
