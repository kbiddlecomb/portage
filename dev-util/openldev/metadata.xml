OpenLDev is a graphical front-end to various Linux development tools
such as gcc, autotools and make. Most Integrated Development
Environments (IDE), are cumbersome and confusing to use, but
OpenLDev strives to provide an easy-to-use interface that is both
productive for experts and simple for beginners.
